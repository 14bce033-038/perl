Abstract:
Web crawlers are very common on the internet. In fact, it is one
of the reasons why google is so successful in searching queries on
the internet.
Basically a web crawler crawls the web directories such as
websites to collect data for specific usage. Google’s web crawler,
known as ‘Spider’, looks for the terms which defines that web site
uniquely or most appropriately so that whenever a query is fired by
someone, it can show relevant results accurately.
Inspired by such thing, we designed a web crawler in perl which
upon giving a source url and depth and width of the search space, it
downloads all the web pages as well as all the images from those web
pages.
Crawling would be essentially what Google, Yahoo, MSN, etc.
do, looking for ANY information. Scraping is generally targeted at
certain websites, for specific data, e.g. for price comparison, so are
coded quite differently.
Perl is a scripting language which is very efficient in terms of
string processing.

Project​ ​Flow:
Here, to design this, we’ve used Perl Strawberry. Following is the
algorithm.

1) Input : SourceURL, Width and Depth of search space.
2) Fetch the SourceURL & insert it into SetofURL.
3) While Depth is greater than 0
a) Take the first URL from the SetofURL. Let it be,
CurrentURL.
b) Extract & store all the images from the CurrentURL.
c) For i = 1 up to Width
i) Extract all the URLs from the CurrentURL and insert
them to the SetofURL.
d) Store the CurrentURL to a file.
e) Decrease Depth by 1
4) Exit.

Functions​ ​and​ ​Features​ ​of​ ​Perl​ ​Used:
Along with that, we’ve used build-in library ‘LWP:Simple’ to
interact with web and REGEX to extract further URLs from the page.

Methods Used:
1) get(URL) : Fetches the URL into memory or variable.
2) getstore(URL, path) : Stores the URL to the specified path.
3) substr String, initIdx, count : Substrings the provided String
from starting the index initIdx and length of count.
4) s/REGEX/REPLACEMENT : substitutes the REPLACEMENT
wherever the REGEX is matched.
5) Print : prints to the output.
6) Shift : pops the first element of array.

Conclusion:
By doing this project, we could learn and understand the basic
concepts of Perl. Before this project, we did not have any prior
knowledge of Perl. This project helped us in learning, implementing
and using the basic features and few of the advanced features such
as LWP library of Perl programming language. We learnt the basic
features such as loops, control statements and various in-built
functions available in Perl.
